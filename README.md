### ✨ Features

- **Open and browse existing SQLite databases** (.db, .sqlite, .sqlite3)
- **Table selector** with automatic column resizing
- **Inline cell editing** with **undo/redo** support (single cell changes)
- **Add new rows** via a convenient dialog
- **Add & delete columns** (SQLite limitations handled via table recreation)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or newer
- PyQt6

```bash
# Recommended: use a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows

pip install PyQt6
```
Run the application
```Bash
python db_viewer.py
```
or
```bash
python3 db_viewer.py
```

📦 Installation Options

Option 1: Run from source (recommended for development)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sqlite-db-viewer.git
cd sqlite-db-viewer
pip install -r requirements.txt    # if you create one
python db_viewer.py
```
Option 2: One-file executable (using PyInstaller)
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "DBViewer" db_viewer_0.3.py
The executable will appear in the dist/ folder.
```

### ⚙️ Technical Notes

Uses QSqlTableModel + QSqlQuery for database interaction
Edit strategy: OnFieldChange
Undo/redo implemented via QUndoStack and custom QUndoCommand classes
Column deletion & undo is implemented by recreating the table (SQLite limitation)
Query history is basic (timestamp + first 50 chars)

---
### Limitations & Known Issues

- Column deletion requires table recreation → can be slow on large tables
- Undo for column add/delete is basic (doesn't preserve data types perfectly)
-  No support for BLOB viewing/editing
- No foreign key visualization
- No transaction control beyond auto-commit
- Single database connection at a time

Contributions welcome to fix any of these!
